        "question": "Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  Her parents gave her $100 to buy whatever she wanted.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $12, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\"  She scooped up 3 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  How much money does Sally have left?",
        "reasoning_process": "Let's think step by step. Sally scooped up 3 pounds of taffy, so she gets 2 pounds at full price and 1 pound at 1/2 off. Full price of taffy cost 12 * 2 = 24 dollars. Discounted taffy costs 12 - 12 / 2 = 6 dollars. So 24 + 6 = 30 dollars for the taffy. The magnets cost 4 x 0.25 = 1 dollar. So in total she spent 30 + 1.50 + 1 = 32.50 dollars. Sally started with 100 dollars and spent 32.50 dollars, so she has 100 - 32.50 = 67.50 dollars left. The answer is 67.50. #### 67.50"

        "reasoning_process": "Let's think step by step. Camila can peel 5 shrimps a minute, so to peel 90 shrimps, it will take her 90 / 5 = 18 minutes. She can saute 30 shrimps in 7 minutes, so to saute 90 shrimps, it will take her 90 / 30 * 7 = 21 minutes. So in total, it will take her 18 + 21 = 39 minutes to peel and saute 90 shrimps. The answer is 39. #### 39"

        "question": "James is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?",
        "reasoning_process": "Let's think step by step. The probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is 16 / 20 = 0.8. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 10 / 20 * 10 / 20 = 0.25. The difference is 0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, so the answer is 55%. #### 55"
