        "reasoning_process": "Let's think step by step. The worker has to clean 210 floors in 10 days, so they need to clean 210 / 10 = 21 floors per day. It takes them 20 minutes per floor, so they spend 20 * 21 = 420 minutes per day cleaning. So they spend 420 / 60 = 7 hours per day cleaning. They work 10 hours each day, so they spend 7 / 10 * 100 = 70% of their day cleaning. The answer is 70. #### 70",
